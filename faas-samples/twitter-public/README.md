# Twitter Public Templates

In this folder there are three FaaS bot templates for use with Twitter via the LivePerson Social Listening tool. They all can be used to review public Twitter messages mentioning the brand and responding with a link to DM the brand.

- **Auto-Respond** detects tweets mentioning the brand and auto-replies with a link to DM the brand. This bot cannot actually see the tweet content, but it still can be useful for routing these public comments to private conversations with brand customer support agents.

- **Auto-Respond-with-Content** detects tweets mentioning the brand, accesses the text contents of the tweets, and can use rules to respond in different ways depending on the content.

- **Auto-Respond-with-Sentiment-Analysis** detects tweets mentioning the brand, accesses the text contents of the tweets, sends that content to Google for sentiment analysis, and then can respond to the tweet based on the results of that analysis.
